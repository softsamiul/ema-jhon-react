# Concepts:
----------
Hooks: here is two types of hooks.
1. useState()
2. useeffect()
### What is hook?: Hook is nothing but a function.

1. useState(): Use state is nothing but a function. Here is a secial purpose of usestate hook. If inside code anything changed he return the latest value and also a function to change the value.

    Works: He keep tracks inside his body and return if there is anything changed. And also we can change anything from  the function which he returns. And update all the changed things in the ui.

2. useeffect(): useeffect is also a function. It manage all the external data. If we don't give any dependency inside useEffect it will automatically calls the data whenever the site is relod. So. good practice is always try to use dependency.

dependency: Dependency is something if we change the dependency the data will updated or called.

    Works:
